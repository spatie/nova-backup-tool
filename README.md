This [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) tool lets you:
- list all backups
- create a new backup
- download a backup
- delete a backup

Behind the scenes [spatie/laravel-backup](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup) is used.

You can see the tool in action in [this video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wSi2ByavX8).

## Requirements

Make sure you meet [the requirements for installing spatie/laravel-backup](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v5/requirements).

## Installation

First you must install [spatie/laravel-backup](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup) into your Laravel app. The installation instructions are [here](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v6/installation-and-setup). When successfull running `php artisan backup:run` on the terminal should create a backup and `php artisan backup:list` should return a list with an overview of all backup disks.

You can install the nova tool in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/nova-backup-tool
```

Next up, you must register the tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `tools` method of the `NovaServiceProvider`.

```php
// in app/Providers/NovaServiceProvder.php

// ...

public function tools()
{
    return [
        // ...
        new \Spatie\BackupTool\BackupTool(),
    ];
}
```

Finally you should setup [a queue](https://laravel.com/docs/master/queues). This tool doesn't care what kind of queue as long as you don't use the `sync` driver.

## Usage

Click on the "Backups" menu item in your Nova app to see the backup tool.
